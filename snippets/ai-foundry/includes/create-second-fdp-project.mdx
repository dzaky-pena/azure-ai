import FdpProjectName from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/fdp-project-name.mdx'

Create multiple <FdpProjectName />s on an existing `AI Foundry` resource, so you can share your environment with your team for collaboration. 


<FdpProjectName />s as Azure child resources may get assigned their own access controls, but share common settings such as network security, deployments, and Azure tool integration from their parent resource.

Your first project (default project) plays a special role and has access to more features:


| Feature | Default <FdpProjectName /> | Nondefault <FdpProjectName /> |
|--|--|--|
| Model inference | ✅ | ✅ |
| Playgrounds | ✅ | ✅ |
| Agents | ✅ | ✅ |
| Evaluations | ✅ | ✅ |
| Connections | ✅ | ✅ |
| AI Foundry API that works with agents and across models | ✅ | ✅ |
| Project-level isolation of files and outputs | ✅ | ✅ |
| Azure OpenAI with Batch, StoredCompletions, Fine-tuning | ✅ |  |
| Backwards compatible with project-less {account}.cognitiveservices.com data plane API | ✅ |  |
| Content safety | ✅ |  |

* To add a nondefault project to a resource:
    
    # [Azure AI Foundry portal](#tab/ai-foundry)
    
import TipLeftPane from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/tip-left-pane.mdx'

    <TipLeftPane />

    1. In [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs), select either the <FdpProjectName /> or its associated resource.
    1. In the left pane, select **Management center**.
    1. In the resource section, select  **Overview**.

            ![](/images/ai-foundry/media/how-to/projects/second-project.png)
        </Frame>

    
    # [Python SDK](#tab/python)
    
    Add this code to your script to create a new project on your existing resource:

    :::code language="python" source="~/foundry-samples-main/samples/microsoft/python/mslearn-resources/quickstart/create_project.py" id="create_additional":::
    
    
    # [Azure CLI](#tab/azurecli)

    CLI commands not currently available for creating a <FdpProjectName />.

    ---

* If you delete your Foundry resource's default project, the next project created will become the default project.
