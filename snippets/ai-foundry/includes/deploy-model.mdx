To work with a model, you first deploy it into a project. 

import TipLeftPane from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/tip-left-pane.mdx'

<TipLeftPane />

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).
1. Studio remembers where you were last, so what you do next depends on where you are:

import HubProjectName from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/hub-project-name.mdx'
import FdpProjectName from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/fdp-project-name.mdx'

    * If you see a list of projects, select the one you want to use.  You can use either a <HubProjectName /> or a <FdpProjectName />.
    * If you're already in a project and want to use a new one, select **Azure AI Foundry** in the top left corner, then select **Create new** to create the new project.
    * If you're new to Azure AI Foundry and don't have any projects, use [Quickstart: Get started with Azure AI Foundry](../quickstarts/get-started-code) instead of this article.

1. Select **Model catalog** from the left pane.

1. Select the **gpt-4o-mini** model from the list of models. You can use the search bar to find it.
