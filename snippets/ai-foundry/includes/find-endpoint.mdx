import HubProjectName from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/hub-project-name.mdx'
import FdpProjectName from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/fdp-project-name.mdx'

If you don't see the **Azure AI Foundry project endpoint**, you're using a <HubProjectName />. (See [Types of projects](../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#project-types)). Switch to a <FdpProjectName />, or use the preceding steps to create one.
