As opposite to GitHub Models where all the models are already configured, the Azure AI Services resource allows you to control which models are available in your endpoint and under which configuration.

You can add all the models you need in the endpoint by using [Azure AI Foundry for GitHub](https://ai.azure.com/github). In the following example, we add a `Mistral-Large` model in the service:

1. Go to **Model catalog** section in [Azure AI Foundry for GitHub](https://ai.azure.com/github).

2. Scroll to the model you're interested in and select it.

3. You can review the details of the model in the model card.

4. Select **Deploy**.

5. For models providers that require extra terms of contract, you're asked to accept those terms. For instance, Mistral models ask you to accept other terms. Accept the terms on those cases by selecting **Subscribe and deploy**.

6.  You can configure the deployment settings at this time. By default, the deployment receives the name of the model you're deploying. The deployment name is used in the `model` parameter for request to route to this particular model deployment. This setting allows you to also configure specific names for your models when you attach specific configurations. For instance, `o1-preview-safe` for a model with a strict  content filter.

   <Tip>
   Each model may support different deployments types, providing different data residency or throughput guarantees. See [deployment types](/azure/ai-studio/ai-services/concepts/deployment-types) for more details.

7.  Use the **Customize** option if you need to change settings like [content filter](/azure/ai-studio/concepts/content-filtering) or rate limiting (if available).

8.  Select **Deploy**.

9.  Once the deployment completes, the new model will be listed in the page and it's ready to be used.
