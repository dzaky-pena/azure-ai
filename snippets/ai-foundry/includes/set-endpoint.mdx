To use LLMs deployed in Azure AI Foundry portal, you need the endpoint and credentials to connect to it. Follow these steps to get the information you need from the model you want to use:

1. Go to the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).

1. Open the project where the model is deployed, if it isn't already open.

1. Go to **Models + endpoints** and select the model you deployed as indicated in the prerequisites.

1. Copy the endpoint URL and the key.

    <Tip>
    If your model was deployed with Microsoft Entra ID support, you don't need a key.
    </Tip>

In this scenario, set the endpoint URL and key as environment variables. (If the endpoint you copied includes additional text after `/models`, remove it so the URL ends at `/models` as shown below.)

```bash
export AZURE_INFERENCE_ENDPOINT="https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/models"
export AZURE_INFERENCE_CREDENTIAL="<your-key-goes-here>"
```
