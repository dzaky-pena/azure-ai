In this article, you learn how to create the resources required to use Azure AI Foundry Models in your projects.

## Understand the resources

Azure AI Foundry Models is a capability in Azure AI Foundry Services (formerly known Azure AI Services). You can create model deployments under the resource to consume their predictions. You can also connect the resource to Azure AI Hubs and Projects in Azure AI Foundry to create intelligent applications if needed. The following picture shows the high level architecture.

Azure AI Foundry Services don't require AI projects or AI hubs to operate and you can create them to consume flagship models from your applications. However, additional capabilities are available if you **deploy an Azure AI project and hub**, including playground, or agents.

The tutorial helps you create:

<Check>
* An Azure AI Foundry resource.
* A model deployment for each of the models supported with serverless API deployments.
* (Optionally) An Azure AI project and hub.
* (Optionally) A connection between the hub and the models in Azure AI Foundry.
</Check>

## Prerequisites

To complete this article, you need:

* An Azure subscription. If you're using [GitHub Models](https://docs.github.com/en/github-models/), you can upgrade your experience and create an Azure subscription in the process. Read [Upgrade from GitHub Models to Azure AI Foundry](../../how-to/quickstart-github-models) if that's your case.
