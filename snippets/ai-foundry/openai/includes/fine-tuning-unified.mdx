description: Learn how to create your own custom model with Azure OpenAI by using the Azure AI Foundry portal.

There are two unique fine-tuning experiences in the Azure AI Foundry portal:

* [Hub/Project view](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) - supports fine-tuning models from multiple providers including Azure OpenAI, Meta Llama, Microsoft Phi, etc.
* [Azure OpenAI centric view](https://ai.azure.com/resource/overview) - only supports fine-tuning Azure OpenAI models, but has support for additional features like the [Weights & Biases (W&B) preview integration](../how-to/weights-and-biases-integration). 

If you are only fine-tuning Azure OpenAI models, we recommend the Azure OpenAI centric fine-tuning experience which is available by navigating to [https://ai.azure.com/resource/overview](https://ai.azure.com/resource/overview).
