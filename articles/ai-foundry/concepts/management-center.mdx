# Management center overview

The management center is a part of the Azure AI Foundry portal that streamlines governance and management activities. From the management center, you can manage:

import Hub from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/hub-project-name.mdx'

- Azure AI Foundry hubs and <Hub />s
import Fdp from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/fdp-project-name.mdx'

- Azure AI <Fdp />s
- Quotas for models and virtual machines (VMs)

    <Note>

    VM quotas are only available for <Hub />s.
    </Note>
- User management and role assignment

To access the management center, sign in to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs), select a project, and then select **Management center** from the bottom of left menu.

## Manage Foundry projects

Use the management center to create and configure <Fdp />s. Use __All resources__ to view all <Fdp />s that you have access to, or to create new projects. Use the __Project__ section of the left menu to manage individual <Fdp />.

### Manage Azure AI Foundry hubs and hub based projects

You can also manage <Hub />s from the management center. They're listed in the __All resources__ section, and when selected are displayed in the left menu.

import HubProjectName from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/hub-project-name.mdx'

For more information, see [Create a <HubProjectName />](../how-to/create-projects).

## Manage resource utilization

View and manage quotas and usage metrics across multiple projects and Azure subscriptions. Use the __Quota__ link from the left menu to view and manage quotas.
