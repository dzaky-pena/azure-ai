# Tutorial: Explore Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry Models embeddings and document search

This tutorial will walk you through using the Azure OpenAI [embeddings](../concepts/understand-embeddings) API to perform **document search** where you'll query a knowledge base to find the most relevant document.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

<Check>
* Install Azure OpenAI.
* Download a sample dataset and prepare it for analysis.
* Create environment variables for your resources endpoint and API key.
* Use one of the following models: text-embedding-ada-002 (Version 2), text-embedding-3-large, text-embedding-3-small  models.
* Use [cosine similarity](../concepts/understand-embeddings) to rank search results.
</Check>

<Tab title="Python">
import Python from '/snippets/ai-foundry/openai/includes/embeddings-python.mdx'

<Python />
</Tab>

<Tab title="PowerShell">
import Powershell from '/snippets/ai-foundry/openai/includes/embeddings-powershell.mdx'

<Powershell />
</Tab>
</Tabs>
Using this approach, you can use embeddings as a search mechanism across documents in a knowledge base. The user can then take the top search result and use it for their downstream task, which prompted their initial query.

## Clean up resources

If you created an Azure OpenAI resource solely for completing this tutorial and want to clean up and remove an Azure OpenAI resource, you'll need to delete your deployed models, and then delete the resource or associated resource group if it's dedicated to your test resource. Deleting the resource group also deletes any other resources associated with it.
