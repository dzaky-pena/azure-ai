# Customize a model with fine-tuning

Azure OpenAI in Azure AI Foundry Models lets you tailor our models to your personal datasets by using a process known as *fine-tuning*. This customization step lets you get more out of the service by providing:

- Higher quality results than what you can get just from [prompt engineering](../concepts/prompt-engineering)
- The ability to train on more examples than can fit into a model's max request context limit.
- Token savings due to shorter prompts
- Lower-latency requests, particularly when using smaller models.

In contrast to few-shot learning, fine tuning improves the model by training on many more examples than can fit in a prompt, letting you achieve better results on a wide number of tasks. Because fine tuning adjusts the base model’s weights to improve performance on the specific task, you won’t have to include as many examples or instructions in your prompt. This means less text sent and fewer tokens processed on every API call, potentially saving cost, and improving request latency.

We use LoRA, or low rank adaptation, to fine-tune models in a way that reduces their complexity without significantly affecting their performance. This method works by approximating the original high-rank matrix with a lower rank one, thus only fine-tuning a smaller subset of *important* parameters during the supervised training phase, making the model more manageable and efficient. For users, this makes training faster and more affordable than other techniques.
