This article provides some high-level details regarding how Azure AI Translator processes data provided by customers.

## What data does Translator process? 

- **Text translation**: Processes textual content submitted by the customer in plain text or HTML format. Text translation translates text by using either general or custom machine translation models.
- **Document translation**: Processes rich documents in a variety of formats including plain text, HTML, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, .pdf, .md, and others. Document translation translates documents by using either general or custom machine translation models.

## Does Translator keep my data? 

Translator doesn’t persist customer data submitted for translation:

- **Text translation** processes customer data at REST and doesn’t store customer data.
- **Document translation** temporarily stores customer data while processing. After processing, the customer data is removed permanently with a hard delete. No customer data is persisted.
