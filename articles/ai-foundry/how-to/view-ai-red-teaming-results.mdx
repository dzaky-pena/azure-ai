# Viewing AI red teaming results in Azure AI Foundry project (preview)

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview)]

After your automated scan is finished running [locally](./develop/run-scans-ai-red-teaming-agent) or [remotely](./develop/run-ai-red-teaming-cloud), the results also get logged to your Azure AI Foundry project which you specified in the creation of your AI red teaming agent.

## View report of each scan

In your Azure AI Foundry project or hub based project, navigate to the **Evaluations** page and select the **AI red teaming** tab to view the comprehensive report with a detailed drill-down of each scan.

Once you select into the scan, you can view the report by risk categories, which shows you the overall number of successful attacks and a breakdown of successful attacks per risk categories:

</Frame>

Or by attack complexity classification:

</Frame>

Drilling down further into the data tab provides a row-level view of each attack-response pair, enabling deeper insights into system issues and behaviors. For each attack-response pair, you can see additional information such as whether or not the attack was successful, what attack strategy was used and its attack complexity. There's also an option for a human in the loop reviewer to provide human feedback by selecting the thumbs up or thumbs down icon.

To view each conversation, selecting **View more** opens up the full conversation for more detailed analysis of the AI system's response.
