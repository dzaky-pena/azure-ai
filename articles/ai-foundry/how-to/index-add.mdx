# How to build and consume vector indexes in Azure AI Foundry portal

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../includes/feature-preview)]

In this article, you learn how to create and use a vector index for performing [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](../concepts/retrieval-augmented-generation) in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

A vector index isn't required for RAG, but a vector query can match on semantically similar content, which is useful for RAG workloads.

## Prerequisites

You must have:
- An Azure AI Foundry project
- An [Azure AI Search resource](/azure/search/search-create-service-portal)
- You should have content in a supported format that provides sufficient information for a chat experience. It can be an existing index on Azure AI Search, or create a new index using content files in Azure Blob Storage, your local system, or data in Azure AI Foundry.

## Create an index from the Chat playground

[!INCLUDE [tip-left-pane](../includes/tip-left-pane)]

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).
1. Go to your project or [create a new project](../how-to/create-projects) in Azure AI Foundry portal.
1. From the menu on the left, select **Playgrounds**. Select the **Chat Playground**.

    </Frame>

1. Select a deployed chat completion model. If you have not done so already, deploy a model by selecting **Create new deployment**.

    </Frame>

1. Scroll to the bottom of the model window. Select **+ Add a new data source**

    </Frame>

1. Choose your **Source data**. You can choose source data from a list of your recent data sources, a storage URL on the cloud, or upload files and folders from the local machine. You can also add a connection to another data source such as Azure Blob Storage.

   If you don't have sample data, you can [download these PDFs](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-search-sample-data/tree/main/health-plan) to your local system, and then upload them as your source data.

    </Frame>

1. Select **Next** after choosing source data
1. Choose the **Index Storage** - the location where you want your index to be stored in the **Index configuration** tab. 
1. If you already have an Azure AI Search resource, you can browse the list of search service resources for your subscription and then select **Connect** for the one you want to use. If you're connecting with API keys, confirm your search service [uses API keys](/azure/search/search-security-api-keys).

        ![](/images/ai-foundry/media/index-retrieve/index-storage.png)
    </Frame>

    1. If you don't have an existing resource, choose **Create a new Azure AI Search resource**. Select **Next**.
  
1. Select the Azure OpenAI connection you want to use. Select **Next**.
    
1. Enter a name you want to use for your vector index. Select **Next**.
1. Review the details you entered and select **Create**
1. You're taken to the index details page where you can see the status of your index creation.

## Use an index in prompt flow

1. Sign in to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) and select your project. 
1. From the collapsible left menu, select **Prompt flow** from the **Build and customize** section.
1. Open an existing prompt flow or select **+ Create** to create a new flow.
1. On the top menu of the flow designer, select **More tools**, and then select ***Index Lookup***.

    <Frame>

    </Frame>

1. Provide a name for your Index Lookup Tool and select **Add**.
1. Select the **mlindex_content** value box, and select your index from the value section. After completing this step, enter the queries and **query_types** to be performed against the index.
