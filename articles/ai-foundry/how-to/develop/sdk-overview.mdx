# Azure AI Foundry SDK client libraries

The Azure AI Foundry SDK is a comprehensive toolchain designed to simplify the development of AI applications on Azure. It enables developers to:

- Access popular models from various model providers through a single interface
- Easily combine together models, data, and AI services to build AI-powered applications
- Evaluate, debug, and improve application quality & safety across development, testing, and production environments

The Azure AI Foundry SDK is a set of client libraries and services designed to work together.

import Hub from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/hub-project-name.mdx'

This article applies to a **<Fdp />**. The code shown here doesn't work for a **<Hub />**. For more information, see [Types of projects](../../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#project-types).
</Note>

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
import FdpProjectName from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/fdp-project-name.mdx'

* [Create a <FdpProjectName />](../create-projects) if you don't have one already.
import FindEndpoint from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/find-endpoint.mdx'

* <FindEndpoint />
* Sign in with the Azure CLI using the same account that you use to access your project:

    ```bash
    az login
    ```

## Unified Projects client library

The Azure AI Foundry Projects client library is a unified library that enables you to use multiple client libraries together by connecting to a single project endpoint.

* Install the project client library 

    ```bash
    pip install azure-ai-projects azure-identity
    ```

* Create a project client in code. **Copy** the Azure AI Foundry project endpoint from the Overview page of the project and update the connections string value.

    ```python
    from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
    from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
    
    project = AIProjectClient(
      endpoint="your_project_endpoint",  # Replace with your endpoint
      credential=DefaultAzureCredential())
    ```

* Add these packages to your installation (preview):
    * `com.azure.ai.projects`
    * `com.azure.core`

* Create a project client in code. **Copy** the Azure AI Foundry project endpoint from the Overview page of the project and update the connections string value.

    ```java
    import com.azure.ai.projects.ProjectsClient;
    import com.azure.ai.projects.ProjectsClientBuilder;
    import com.azure.core.credential.AzureKeyCredential;
    
    String endpoint ="your_project_endpoint"; // Replace with your endpoint
    
    ProjectsClient projectClient = new ProjectsClientBuilder()
        .credential(new DefaultAzureCredential())
        .endpoint(endpoint)
        .buildClient();
    ```

    ```

* Create a project client in code. **Copy** the Azure AI Foundry project endpoint from the Overview page of the project and update the connections string value.


    ```javascript
    import { AIProjectClient } from '@azure/ai-projects';
    import { DefaultAzureCredential } from '@azure/identity';
    
    const endpoint = "your_project_endpoint"; // Replace with your actual endpoint
    const project = new AIProjectClient(endpoint, new DefaultAzureCredential());
    ```

* Install packages:

    ```bash
    dotnet add package Azure.Identity
    dotnet add package Azure.Core
    dotnet add package Azure.AI.Inference
    ```

* Create a project client in code. **Copy** the Azure AI Foundry project endpoint from the Overview page of the project and update the connections string value.

    ```csharp
    using Azure;
    using Azure.Identity;
    using Azure.AI.Inference;
    using Azure.Core;
    using Azure.Core.Pipeline;
    
    var endpointUrl = "your_project_endpoint"; // Replace with your actual endpoint
    var credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();
    
    AzureAIInferenceClientOptions clientOptions = new AzureAIInferenceClientOptions();
    BearerTokenAuthenticationPolicy tokenPolicy = new BearerTokenAuthenticationPolicy(
        credential, 
        new string[] { "https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default" }
    );
    clientOptions.AddPolicy(tokenPolicy, HttpPipelinePosition.PerRetry);
    
    var projectClient = new ChatCompletionsClient(
        endpointUrl, 
        credential,
        clientOptions
    );
    ```

* Using the project endpoint, you can:
    - [Use Foundry Model](../../quickstarts/get-started-code), including Azure OpenAI
    - [Use Foundry Agent Service](../../../ai-services/agents/quickstart.md?context=/azure/ai-foundry/context/context)
    - [Run evaluations in the cloud](../../../ai-services/openai/how-to/evaluations.md?context=/azure/ai-foundry/context/context)
    - [Enable tracing for your app](../../concepts/trace) 
    - Retrieve endpoints and keys for external resource connections

## Azure AI Services client libraries

To use Azure AI services, you can use the following client libraries with the endpoints listed on the project homepage.
