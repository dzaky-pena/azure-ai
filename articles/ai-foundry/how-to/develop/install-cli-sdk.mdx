# Set up your development environment

Set up your development environment to use the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) SDK. You also need Azure CLI for authentication so that your code can access your user credentials.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).


## Install your programming language 

<Tab title="Python">

In the IDE of your choice, create a new folder for your project. Open a terminal window in that folder.

[!INCLUDE [Install Python](../../includes/install-python)]

</Tab>

<Tab title="Java">

[!INCLUDE [Install Jave](../../includes/install-java)]

</Tab>

<Tab title="JavaScript">

[!INCLUDE [install-csharp](../../includes/install-csharp)]

</Tab>

<a name="installs"></a>
