# Set up your development environment

Set up your development environment to use the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) SDK. You also need Azure CLI for authentication so that your code can access your user credentials.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).


## Install your programming language
