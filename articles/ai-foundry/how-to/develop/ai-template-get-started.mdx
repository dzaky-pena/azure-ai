# Get started with an AI template

Streamline your code-first development with prebuilt, task-specific Azure AI templates. Benefit from using the latest features and best practices from Microsoft Azure AI, with popular frameworks like LangChain, prompt flow, and Semantic Kernel in multiple languages.

Available templates include:

* [Get started with AI chat](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-chat)
* [Get started with AI agents](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/get-started-with-ai-agents)
* [Unlock insights from conversational data](https://github.com/microsoft/Conversation-Knowledge-Mining-Solution-Accelerator)

## Prerequisites

- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free)
import FdpProjectName from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/fdp-project-name.mdx'
import HubProjectName from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/hub-project-name.mdx'

- Either a [<FdpProjectName />](../create-projects) or a [<HubProjectName />](../create-projects).

## Start with a sample application

import TipLeftPane from '/snippets/ai-foundry/includes/tip-left-pane.mdx'

<TipLeftPane />

1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs).
1. Open your project in Azure AI Foundry portal.
1. On the left pane, select **Templates**.
1. Find the solution template you want to use.
1. Select **Open in Github** to view the entire sample application.
1. In some cases, you can also view a step-by-step tutorial that explains the AI code.

## Explore the sample application

Once you're looking at the GitHub repository for your sample, refer to the README for more instructions and information on how to deploy your own version of the application.

Instructions vary by sample, but most include how to:

* Open the solution in the location of your choice:
  * GitHub Codespaces
  * VS Code Dev Containers
  * Your local IDE
* Deploy the application to Azure
* How to test the app

The README also includes information about the application, such as the use case, architecture, and pricing information.
