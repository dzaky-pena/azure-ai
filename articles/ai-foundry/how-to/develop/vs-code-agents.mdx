# Work with Azure AI Foundry Agent Service in Visual Studio Code (Preview)

After you [get started with the AI Foundry the VS Code extension](./get-started-projects-vs-code), you can work with [Azure AI Foundry Agent Service](/azure/ai-services/agents/overview). Agents are "smart" microservices that:

- Answer questions using their training data or search other sources with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Perform specific actions
- Automate complete workflows

Agents combine AI models with tools to access and interact with your data.

Azure AI Foundry developers can stay productive by developing, testing, and deploying agents in the familiar and powerful environment of VS Code.

[!INCLUDE [feature-preview](../../includes/feature-preview)]

###    Create and edit Azure AI Agents within the designer view

Follow these steps to create an Azure AI Agent:

1. First, finish the [Get Started](./get-started-projects-vs-code.md#get-started) section to sign in to your Azure resources and set your default project.
 
1. [Deploy a model](./get-started-projects-vs-code.md#deploy-a-model-from-the-model-catalog) to use with your agent.

1. In the Azure AI Foundry Extension view, find the **Resources** section.

1. Select the **+** (plus) icon next to the **Agents** subsection to create a new AI Agent.

    </Frame>

### Interact with your agent in the designer

After you choose your save location, both the agent .yaml file and the Designer view will open to edit your AI Agent.

1. Perform the following tasks in the agent designer:

    1. Enter a name for your agent in the prompt.

    1. Select your model deployment name from the dropdown. The deployment name is what you chose when you deployed an existing model.

    1. Configure the following fields. The **ID** is generated by the extension:
    
       - Add a description for your agent
       - Set system instructions 
       - Configure tools for agent use

        <Frame>
            ![](/images/ai-foundry/media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-designer.png)
        </Frame>

    1. To save the .yaml file, select **File** > **Save** in the VS Code menu bar.

###    Explore the Azure AI Agent YAML definition

Your AI Agent .yaml file was opened at the same time the designer was. This file contains the details and setup information for your agent, similar to the following .yaml file example: 

```yml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://aka.ms/ai-foundry-vsc/agent/1.0.0
version: 1.0.0
name: my-agent
description: Description of the agent
id: ''
metadata:
  authors:
    - author1
    - author2
  tags:
    - tag1
    - tag2
model:
  id: 'gpt-4o-1'
  options:
    temperature: 1
    top_p: 1
instructions: Instructions for the agent
tools: []
```

### Add tools to the Azure AI Agent


Azure AI Agent Service has a set of knowledge and action tools that you can use to interact with your data sources. 


#### Available tools for Azure AI Agents

The following tools are available:

- Knowledge tools:
  - [Grounding with Bing search](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding?tabs=python&pivots=overview)
  - [File search]( /azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/file-search?tabs=python&pivots=overview)
  - [Azure AI Search](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/azure-ai-search?tabs=pythonsdk&pivots=overview)   
  - [Microsoft Fabric](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/fabric?pivots=portal)

- Action tools:
  - [Azure AI Agents function calling](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/function-calling?pivots=python)

Azure AI Foundry Agent Service has a set of knowledge and action tools that you can use to interact with your data sources, such as:
 - [Grounding with Bing search](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding?tabs=python&pivots=overview)
 - [Azure AI Search](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/azure-ai-search?tabs=pythonsdk&pivots=overview) 
 - [Azure Functions](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/azure-functions?tabs=python&pivots=overview) 
 - [File search](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/file-search?tabs=python&pivots=overview) 
 - [Code interpreter](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/code-interpreter?tabs=python&pivots=overview)
 - [OpenAPI Specified tools](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/openapi-spec?tabs=python&pivots=overview)
 - [SharePoint](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/sharepoint?tabs=python&pivots=overview)

#### Configure the tools YAML file

The Agent Designer adds tools to an AI Agent via .yaml files. 

Create a tool configuration .yaml file using the following steps:

1. Choose a tool from the [available tools for Azure AI Agents](#available-tools-for-azure-ai-agents). Perform any setup steps that might be required. For example, [Grounding with Bing search](/azure/ai-services/agents/how-to/tools/bing-grounding?tabs=python&pivots=overview#setup).

1. Once you complete the setup, create a yaml code file that specifies the tool's configuration. For example, this format for Grounding with Bing Search:

    ```yml
    type: bing_grounding
    options:
      tool_connections:
        - >-
          /subscriptions/<Azure Subscription ID>/resourceGroups/<Azure Resource Group name>/providers/Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/<Azure AI Foundry Project name>/connections/<Bing connection name>
    ```
1. Replace the placeholders in the connection string under the `tool_connections` section with your information: 
    
    - Azure Subscription ID
    - Azure Resource Group name
    - Azure AI Foundry Project name
    - Bing connection name

1. To save the .yaml file, select **File** > **Save** in the VS Code menu bar.

#### Connect the tools file to the AI Agent

Add a tool to the AI Agent with the following steps:

1. Select the **Add tool** button in the top-right corner of the **TOOL** section in the designer to show the dropdown. Choose the tool you want to add.

### Interact with Agents using agents playground

Open the **Agents Playground** using the following steps:

1. Right-click on your deployed agent and select the **Open Playground** option This action starts a thread with your agent and let you send messages. 

1. Alternatively, select the **Agent Playground** link in the **Tools** subsection, and select your agent from the top-center list. 

1. The **Playground** page is displayed.

    <Frame>
        ![](/images/ai-foundry/media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-display-playground.png)
    </Frame>

1. Type your prompt and see the outputs. The **Grounding with Bing search** tool is used to search the web for information. The agent uses the model and tools you configured in the agent designer. The source of the information is displayed in the **Agent Annotations** section, highlighted in the following image. 

    <Frame>
        ![](/images/ai-foundry/media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/agent-playground-run.png)
    </Frame>

## Explore Threads

The **Threads** subsection displays the threads created during a run with your agent. In the Azure Resources Extension view, select the **caret** icon in front of the **Threads** subsection to view the list of threads.

<Frame>
    ![](/images/ai-foundry/media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/thread-list.png)
</Frame>

###  View thread details

Select a thread to see the **Thread Details** page.

<Frame>
    ![](/images/ai-foundry/media/how-to/get-started-projects-vs-code/thread-view.png)
</Frame>

- A **Thread** is a conversation session between an agent and a user. Threads store **Messages** and automatically handle truncation to fit content into a model's context.

- A **Message** is a single interaction between the agent and the user. Messages can include text, images, and other files. Messages are stored as a list on the Thread.

- A **Run** is a single execution of an agent. Each run can have multiple threads, and each thread can have multiple messages. The agent uses its configuration and Thread's Messages to perform tasks by calling models and tools. As part of a Run, the agent appends Messages to the Thread.

###  View run details

Select the **View run info** button in the **Thread Details** page to see the run information in a JSON file.
