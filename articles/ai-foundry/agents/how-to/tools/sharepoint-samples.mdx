# How to use the SharePoint tool

<Note>
This article describes the Microsoft SharePoint tool for Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. For information on using and deploying SharePoint sites, see the [SharePoint documentation](/sharepoint/). 
</Note>

Use this article to find step-by-step instructions and code samples for using the SharePoint tool in Azure AI Foundry Agent Service.

## Prerequisites

* Your Azure AI Foundry Project endpoint.

import EndpointStringPortal from '/snippets/ai-foundry/agents/includes/endpoint-string-portal.mdx'

    <EndpointStringPortal />

    Save this endpoint to an environment variable named `PROJECT_ENDPOINT`. 


* The name of your SharePoint connection name. You can find it in the Azure AI Foundry portal by selecting **Management center** from the left navigation menu. Then selecting **Connected resources**.
    
    <Frame>
      ![](/images/ai-foundry/agents/media/tools/sharepoint-connection.png)
    </Frame>

    Save this endpoint to an environment variable named `SHAREPOINT_RESOURCE_NAME`


* The names of your model's deployment name. You can find it in **Models + Endpoints** in the left navigation menu. 

    <Frame>
      ![](/images/ai-foundry/agents/media/tools/model-deployment-portal.png)
    </Frame>

    Save the name of your model deployment name as an environment variable named `MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`. 

## Create a project client

Create a client object, which will contain the connection string for connecting to your AI project and other resources.

```python
import os
from azure.ai.projects import AIProjectClient
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.agents.models import SharepointTool

# Retrieve the endpoint and credentials
project_endpoint = os.environ["PROJECT_ENDPOINT"]  # Ensure the PROJECT_ENDPOINT environment variable is set

# Initialize the AIProjectClient
project_client = AIProjectClient(
    endpoint=os.environ["PROJECT_ENDPOINT"],
    credential=DefaultAzureCredential(),
)
``` 

## Create an agent with the Sharepoint tool enabled

To make the Microsoft Fabric tool available to your agent, use a connection to initialize the tool and attach it to the agent. You can find your connection in the **connected resources** section of your project in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

```python

conn_id = project_client.connections.get(name=os.environ["SHAREPOINT_RESOURCE_NAME"]).id

# Initialize Sharepoint tool with connection id
sharepoint = SharepointTool(connection_id=conn_id)

# Create an agent with the Fabric tool
# Create an Agent with the Fabric tool and process an Agent run
with project_client:
    agents_client = project_client.agents

    agent = agents_client.create_agent(
        model=os.environ["MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"],
        name="my-agent",
        instructions="You are a helpful agent",
        tools=sharepoint.definitions,
    )
    print(f"Created agent, ID: {agent.id}")
```

## Create a thread

```python
# Create thread for communication
thread = agents_client.threads.create()
print(f"Created thread, ID: {thread.id}")

# Create message to thread
message = agents_client.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="Hello, summarize the key points of the <sharepoint_resource_document>",
)
print(f"Created message, ID: {message.id}")
```

## Create a run and check the output

```python
# Create and process agent run in thread with tools
run = agents_client.runs.create_and_process(thread_id=thread.id, agent_id=agent.id)
print(f"Run finished with status: {run.status}")

if run.status == "failed":
    print(f"Run failed: {run.last_error}")

# Uncomment the following lines to delete the agent when done
#agents_client.delete_agent(agent.id)
#print("Deleted agent")

# Fetch and log all messages
messages = agents_client.messages.list(thread_id=thread.id)
for msg in messages:
    if msg.text_messages:
        last_text = msg.text_messages[-1]
        print(f"{msg.role}: {last_text.text.value}")
```

<Tab title="REST API">

## Create an agent

Follow the [REST API Quickstart](../../quickstart) to set the right values for the environment variables `AGENT_TOKEN`, `AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` and `API_VERSION`.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url $AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT/assistants?api-version=$API_VERSION \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "instructions": "You are a helpful agent.",
        "name": "my-agent",
        "model": "gpt-4o",
        "tools": [
          {
            "type": "sharepoint_grounding",
            "sharepoint_grounding": {
                "connections": [
                    {
                        "connection_id": "/subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/<your-rg-name>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<your-ai-services-name>/projects/<your-project-name>/connections/<your-sharepoint-connection-name>"
                    }
                ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }'
```

## Create a thread

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url $AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT/threads?api-version=$API_VERSION \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d ''
```

### Add a user question to the thread

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url $AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT/threads/thread_abc123/messages?api-version=$API_VERSION \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What is the weather in Seattle?"
    }'
```

## Run the thread

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url $AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT/threads/thread_abc123/runs?api-version=$API_VERSION \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "assistant_id": "asst_abc123",
  }'
```

## Retrieve the status of the run

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url $AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT/threads/thread_abc123/runs/run_abc123?api-version=$API_VERSION \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN"
```

## Retrieve the agent response

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url $AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_PROJECT_ENDPOINT/threads/thread_abc123/messages?api-version=$API_VERSION \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENT_TOKEN"
```
